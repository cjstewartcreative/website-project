        <p class="livetxt">At Valley Studios we’ve been pushing hard to offer truly unique services that you will struggle to find anywhere else. As we’re based in a theatre, we have the perfect mix of studio recording gear and live performance space, so we tried to figure out ways for artists to get the most out of their time at Valley. <br><br>Introducing: Live from Valley Studios.<br><br>Our livestream services offer bands and artists a unique experience that has only been offered to larger and more established acts in the past. <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> us for more information, to book a session, or to book a visit.</p>

        <p class=livetxt2>Live at Valley Studios is a multi camera live performance setting that allows an audience of up to 150 people. But this service isn’t just limited to music. We can open up to poetry, comedy, drama and so much more. Valley Studios records the entire livestream and presents it mastered to the artist within 14 days of the performance. All performances must be original or free from copyright.<br><br>As each situation is unique, we can’t post a standard price. If acts are bringing an audience there must be a minimum 20 minute intermission to allow us to open the bar. Audience entry must be ticketed and Valley Studios takes a percentage. But the rest belongs to you. Valley studios minimum ticket taking is £3.50 per person. <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> us for further information on bookings.</p>

        <p class=livetxt3>Live from Valley Studios offers great opportunities to capture a live performance in a closed or audience setting. It also opens up your performance to the world through our livestreaming function. How we do it is up to you. You can host a private link, open it up to the world or just record it locally for distribution at a later date. <br><br>We can also allow pay walls and/or a donation function to be paid to the artist within 7 days of the performance. <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> us for more information, to book a session, or to book a visit.</p>
