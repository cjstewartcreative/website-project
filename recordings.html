    <p class="rectxt">Valley Studios offers the capability to record up to 48 channels in one go, and our large live room allows bands, choirs and small orchestras to set up and perform with ease. Rates for the large room start at £200 per 8 hours and discounts are available if booking multiple blocks or full weekends. <br><br>Our grand piano is also available for use on any project. The piano is an extra £25 including tuning. Each session is totally unique and requires something different. <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> us for further information on discounts and bookings.</P>

    <p class=rectxt2>Valley Studios understands the struggle of being a solo artist or a duo. Spreading the cost is either not an option or it just doesn’t stretch as far as it would with a full band. That’s why we offer 4 hours in our recording booth for only £70. This time, if spent wisely can result in up to 3 songs recorded and mixed, assuming the use of backing tracks or simple acoustic instruments. Discounts are available if booking multiple blocks. Each session is totally unique and requires something different. <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> us for further information on discounts and bookings.</p>

    <p class=rectxt3>Are you a smaller band that doesn’t require use of our large room? Are you looking for a more focused and tighter sound? At a cost of only £160 for 8 hours, our recording booth is the answer for you! With a slate diffusion wall, acoustically designed wall taper, and absorbent treatment, our recording booth offers a dry, but not dead, sound. Discounts are available if booking multiple blocks or full weekends. Each session is totally unique and requires something different. <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> us for further information on discounts and bookings.</p>

    <p class=rectxt4>Have you had a track or album recorded elsewhere and are looking to have your tracks mixed? Are you a videographer or film crew looking for mixing facilities or a mixing engineer? Valley studios has you covered! Prices are dependant of project size and scope. <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> us for more information.<br><br>Check out our video tour on <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube!</a></p>
